    <h3>Workers</h3>
    <p>Workers allow us to run scripts in background threads. That means that our main program/js file can be running
      and the worker will take care of an specific task in the background.<br>Since JS is single-thread, take this approach
      is very usefull when we need to perform complex operations but still need our main app up and running.<br>
      It's an object that runs a named JS file containing our code to be executed in the worker thread.<br>
      Limitations are, for example, we cannot manipulate the DOM with a worker instance. But anything related with the global object (window).<br>
      The postMessage() method is the one that is used to send the data between workers, and they respond via the "onmessage" event handler.
