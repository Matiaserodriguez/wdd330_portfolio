      <h1>Use of Fetch</h1>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      
      <h3>Supplying request options</h3>
      <p>The fetch() method can be used in an asynchronous function with the keyword "await" before it, or using ".then()" method.<br>
        fetch() can optionally accept a second parameter where we can specify the HTTP requests methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, 
        as well as the mode no-cors, *cors, same-origin (used to get permission to access selected resources from a server, on a different origin (domain) to which it belongs.
        Inside of this same parameter we can specify: "cache", "credentials", "redirect", "referrerPolicy" 
        and both the "headers" and the "body" in case it's necessary (for instance, we don't pass anything to the body in a GET request).<br>
        
        <strong><br>QUESTION: </strong> what is the best way to manage the CORS policy to prevent anything that may cause problems?
